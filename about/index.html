        <p>
            I'm the founder and principal analyst at Aline
            Analytics, turning complex data into clear,
            actionable insights. With experience in compensation
            analysis, advanced proficiency in Excel, SQL, and Python,
            I help organizations make informed, strategic decisions.
            My work is grounded in both precision and practicality,
            ensuring every analysis drives meaningful impact.
            <br>
            <br>
            I believe the best results come from collaboration - working
            closely with teams and clients to understand their goals
            and deliver insights that create real value. Whether it's
            designing reports, modeling data, or tackling analytical
            challenges, I bring curiosity, rigor, and a modern approach
            to every project.
