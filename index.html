            <p>
                Aline Analytics helps growing companies align pay, bonuses, and raises to the market — so you’re not overpaying, underpaying, or losing great people without realizing why.

        <!-- Why It Matters -->
        <section class="why-it-matters">
            <h2>Why it matters</h2>
            <p>
                Most organizations already spend enough on compensation. We help make sure it’s structured correctly, supports growth, and works as intended. Compensation decisions affect everything — hiring, retention, morale, and growth. We make sure they work for you, not against you.
            </p>

        <!-- Who We Work With -->
        <section class="who-we-work-with">
            <h2>Who we work with</h2>
            <p>
                We partner with small to mid-sized companies (typically 50–200 employees) that are growing, hiring, or navigating change — and want confidence their compensation decisions are sound.
            </p>

        <!-- Our Services -->
        <section class="services">
            <h2>Our focus areas</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Our work focuses on:</p>
            <ul style="margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 20px;">
                <li>Market-aligned base pay</li>
                <li>Thoughtful bonus structures</li>
                <li>Sustainable raise frameworks</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top:0.5em;">
                The goal isn’t to spend more — it’s to spend <strong>intentionally</strong>: retaining talent, managing costs, and avoiding downstream issues from misaligned pay.
