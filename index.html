    <h1>Compensation shouldn’t be a guessing game.</h1>
    <p class="hero-subhead">
      Aline Analytics helps growing companies align pay, bonuses, and raises to the market —
      so you’re not overpaying, underpaying, or losing great people without realizing why.
    </p>
    <p class="hero-supporting">
      Most organizations already spend enough on compensation.
      We help make sure it’s structured correctly, supports growth,
      and works as intended.

    <p>
      We work with small to mid-sized companies (typically 50–200 employees)
      that are growing, hiring, or navigating change — and want confidence
      that their compensation decisions are sound.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work focuses on:
    </p>

    <ul class="service-list">
      <li>Market-aligned base pay</li>
      <li>Thoughtful bonus structures</li>
      <li>Sustainable raise frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="emphasis">
      The goal isn’t to spend more.<br>
      It’s to spend <strong>intentionally</strong> — retaining talent, managing costs,
      and avoiding the downstream issues that come from misaligned pay.

      With clear analyses, executive-ready reporting, and practical guidance,
      we help leadership teams make compensation decisions they can stand behind —
      now and as the business evolves.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<p class="quiet-note">
  Compensation decisions affect everything — hiring, retention, morale, and growth.
  We help make sure they’re working for you, not against you.
