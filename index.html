            <h4>Why it matters</h4>
            <p>Most organizations already spend enough on compensation. We help make sure it’s structured correctly, supports growth, and works as intended. Compensation decisions affect everything — hiring, retention, morale, and growth. We make sure they work for you, not against you.</p>

            <i class="fa-solid fa-handshake"></i>
            <h4>Who we work with</h4>
            <p>We partner with small to mid-sized companies (typically 50–200 employees) that are growing, hiring, or navigating change — and want confidence their compensation decisions are sound.</p>

            <h4>How we help</h4>
            <p>With clear analyses, executive-ready reporting, and practical guidance, we help leadership teams make compensation decisions they can stand behind — now and as the business evolves.</p>
